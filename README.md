# Markov-Brains-Python
A Python implementation of Markov Network Brains, a type of evolvable artificial neural network, first developed by the devolab at Michigan State University. To learn more about Markov Network Brains you can try these articles: http://adamilab.msu.edu/markov-network-brains/  ,  http://devosoft.org/a-quick-introduction-to-markov-network-brains/  , or read the technical paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05601 . 

This repository contains a python implementation of Markov Network Brains, which I created because I wanted to experiment with Markov Network Brains but wanted to continue to use other python code for the problem domain. Since I could find no other Python implementation in existence, I wrote my own. It has not been optimized in any way, but functions well enough for my satisfaction. 

Tested in Python 3.6

The repository has one file that contains the full implemenation, called "markov.py". To use you can simply "import markov" in any python file to gain access to all the written functionality. 

Another file, "example.py" contains a template that demonstrates how to use the code in general.
